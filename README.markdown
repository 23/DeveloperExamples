<h2>Developer Examples for 23 Video and Visualplatform</h2>

Visualplatform is the core development platform for products such as <a href="http://www.23video.com">23 Video</a> and <a href="http://www.visualblog.net">Visualblog</a> from <a href="http://www.23company.com">23</a>. 
As described in the <a href="http://community.23video.com/help/Developers">developer documentation</a> 23's products have been designed explicitly to allow developers to expand, extend and mashup the featureset and the dataset.

The examples listed in this project are meant to illustrate key features in the platform such as how to utitlize the platform APIs or how to integrate data and features with 3rd-party sites.
